# Hamspam-detection
Here it classifies if a given paragraph is offensive or threatening as 'spam' and if a perticular paragraph is not offensive then it classifies it as ham. This is mostly being used to classify emails and send them to perticular inbox or spam folder as such. This can be seen in Gmail also.
